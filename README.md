# TestSolution
#Rearranging array of strings base on an desire order array
In order to implement this ReArrange array tool as part of API we need to perform steps:
1.Create a Web Service project
2.Create the appropiarte controller to be use as part of the method call
3.Include reference to project test.application
4.Making use of dependency injection, bind the interface IStringAnalyzer and the service IStringAnalyzer with the appropiate controller.
